# Test Scripts

This directory contains various test scripts for different services used in the Hyperion backend application.

## Available Test Scripts

### 1. LLM Service Test (`test-llm-service.ts`)

Tests the LLM (Large Language Model) service connectivity and functionality.

### 2. Gemini Image Service Test (`test-gemini-image-service.ts`)

Tests the Google Gemini image processing service.

### 3. TTS Service Test (`test-tts-service.ts`)

Tests the Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio generation service using Google Cloud TTS API.

## TTS Service Test

This script tests the Text-to-Speech functionality including audio generation and timing metadata.

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Credentials**: You need a valid Google Cloud service account key
2. **FFmpeg**: Required for audio duration measurement
3. **Test Data**: Audio segments data in the videos directory

### Setup

1. **Google Cloud Setup**:

   ```bash
   # Create .credentials directory
   mkdir -p .credentials

   # Place your Google Cloud service account key
   # Download from Google Cloud Console and save as:
   # .credentials/gcloud_key.json
   ```

2. **Install FFmpeg**:

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ffmpeg

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install ffmpeg

   # Windows
   # Download from https://ffmpeg.org/
   ```

### Usage

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run test:tts

# Or directly with ts-node
npx ts-node scripts/test-tts-service.ts
```

### Tests Performed

The TTS test script performs the following tests:

1. **Service Initialization**
   - Verifies TTS service can be initialized
   - Checks Google Cloud credentials availability

2. **Audio Generation Test**
   - Tests TTS audio generation for existing lesson segments
   - Measures audio duration and timing metadata

3. **Metadata Retrieval Test**
   - Tests retrieval of timing metadata
   - Validates segment information

4. **Audio File Access Test**
   - Tests retrieval of generated audio files
   - Verifies file integrity

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **Missing Google Cloud Credentials**

   ```
   ‚ùå Google Cloud credentials not found at .credentials/gcloud_key.json
   ```

   - Solution: Download service account key from Google Cloud Console
   - Place the JSON file at `.credentials/gcloud_key.json`

2. **FFmpeg Not Found**

   ```
   ‚ùå Failed to get audio duration: ffprobe command not found
   ```

   - Solution: Install FFmpeg using your system's package manager

3. **No Test Data**

   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è No test data found, creating minimal test...
   ```

   - This is normal if you don't have existing lesson data
   - The script will create a minimal test case

4. **API Quota Exceeded**
   ```
   ‚ùå TTS Service test failed: Quota exceeded
   ```

   - Solution: Check your Google Cloud TTS API quota and billing

## General Prerequisites

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (already done if you're in the main project):

   ```bash
   npm install openai dotenv
   ```

2. Create or update your `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

## Usage

### Running the test script:

```bash
# Using npm script (recommended)
npm run test:openai

# Or directly with ts-node
npx ts-node scripts/test-openai-connectivity.ts
```

## Tests Performed

The script performs the following connectivity tests:

1. **API Key Configuration Test**
   - Verifies that the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set
   - Checks if the API key has the correct format (starts with 'sk-')

2. **Basic Connection Test**
   - Tests basic connectivity to OpenAI API
   - Fetches the list of available models

3. **Chat Completion Test**
   - Tests the chat completions endpoint
   - Sends a simple test message and verifies the response

4. **Model Availability Test**
   - Checks which common models are available in your account
   - Looks for models like gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, text-embedding-ada-002

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Missing API Key**

   ```
   ‚úó API Key Configuration test failed: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set
   ```

   - Solution: Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file

2. **Invalid API Key Format**

   ```
   ‚úó API Key Configuration test failed: OPENAI_API_KEY does not appear to be a valid OpenAI API key format
   ```

   - Solution: Ensure your API key starts with 'sk-'

3. **Network/Authentication Errors**

   ```
   ‚úó Basic Connection test failed: Request failed with status code 401
   ```

   - Solution: Check if your API key is valid and has not expired
   - Verify your OpenAI account has sufficient credits

4. **Model Access Issues**

   ```
   ‚úó Chat Completion test failed: Model gpt-4 is not available
   ```

   - Solution: Use a model available in your OpenAI plan (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo)

## Integration

You can also import and use the test class in your own TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { OpenAIConnectivityTest } from './scripts/test-openai-connectivity';

const tester = new OpenAIConnectivityTest();
await tester.runAllTests();
```
